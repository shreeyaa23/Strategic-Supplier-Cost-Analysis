# Strategic-Supplier-Cost-Analysis
📊 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing procurement and supplier spending to enhance cost efficiency and supplier management for Sky Harvest Industries.
Using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, the project identifies key cost drivers, underutilized suppliers, and commodity-based expenditure patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making for strategic sourcing.

🎯 Objectives

Improve visibility into supplier and commodity-level spending.

Identify top 10 suppliers and their contribution to total procurement costs.

Optimize resource allocation across departments and cost centers.

Develop BI dashboards to monitor procurement KPIs and supplier performance.

🧩 Business Problem

The company faced:

Rising procurement costs due to limited metric visibility.

Uneven supplier utilization across business units.

Lack of consolidated tracking for hardware maintenance and IT infrastructure spend.

These inefficiencies led to missed negotiation opportunities and suboptimal cost control.

💡 Analytical Approach

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Combined procurement, commodity, and supplier datasets using Excel Power Query.

Normalized supplier names and standardized commodity codes.

Built relational tables for department-wise and item-wise spend analysis.

Exploratory Analysis

Used Tableau / Power BI for spend visualization by supplier, commodity, and department.

Implemented Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) to identify suppliers driving 80% of costs.

Measured supplier concentration index to evaluate diversification.

Insights & Visualization

Created interactive BI dashboards showing:

Top suppliers & spend trends

Department-wise cost breakdown

Commodity category distribution

Supplier performance metrics

Highlighted high-spend vendors (IBM, Oracle, Dell) for negotiation leverage.

Optimization Strategy

Proposed supplier consolidation for hardware & networking categories.

Recommended introducing alternate suppliers for software/cloud services.

Suggested 15–20% cost savings potential through renegotiation and diversification.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Power BI / Tableau	Data visualization and trend dashboards
Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables)	Data cleaning, joining, and preprocessing
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) (optional add-on)	Statistical and comparative analysis
SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, RANK)	Data aggregation and supplier spend queries
📈 Key Results

Identified that 3 suppliers accounted for 60% of total spend, enabling targeted negotiations.

Found 22% potential cost reduction by consolidating maintenance contracts.

Improved procurement visibility across departments by 30% through BI dashboards.

Developed data-driven recommendations for supplier diversification and cost efficiency.

🧭 Recommendations

Diversify suppliers in strategic sourcing and IT infrastructure.

Negotiate better terms with high-spend vendors (IBM, Oracle, Dell).

Automate monthly BI reporting to monitor spend dynamics in real time.
