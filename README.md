#  **Strategic Supplier & Cost Analysis ‚Äî Sky Harvest Industries**

##  **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing **procurement and supplier spending** to enhance cost efficiency and supplier management for *Sky Harvest Industries*.  
Using **Power BI, Tableau, and Excel**, the project identifies **key cost drivers, underutilized suppliers, and commodity-based expenditure patterns**, enabling data-driven decision-making for strategic sourcing and negotiation.

##  **Objectives**
- Improve **visibility** into supplier and commodity-level spending.  
- Identify **top 10 suppliers** and their contribution to total procurement costs.  
- Optimize **resource allocation** across departments and cost centers.  
- Develop **interactive BI dashboards** to monitor procurement KPIs and supplier performance.

##  **Business Problem**
The company faced challenges due to:
- Rising procurement costs from **limited metric visibility**.  
- **Uneven supplier utilization** across departments.  
- Lack of consolidated tracking for **hardware maintenance and IT infrastructure spend**.  

These inefficiencies led to missed negotiation opportunities and suboptimal cost control.

##  **Analytical Approach**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Combined procurement, commodity, and supplier datasets using **Excel Power Query**.  
- Normalized supplier names and standardized commodity codes.  
- Built relational tables for department-wise and item-wise spend analysis.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized spending by **supplier, commodity, and department** in **Tableau** and **Power BI**.  
- Applied **Pareto analysis (80/20 rule)** to identify suppliers driving the majority of costs.  
- Measured **supplier concentration index** to assess diversification.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization & Insights**
- Created **interactive BI dashboards** highlighting:  
  - Top suppliers and spend trends  
  - Department-wise cost distribution  
  - Commodity category performance  
  - Supplier performance metrics  
- Found **IBM, Oracle, and Dell** as high-spend vendors with consolidation potential.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization Strategy**
- Recommended **supplier consolidation** for hardware and networking.  
- Introduced **alternate vendors** for software and cloud services.  
- Estimated **15‚Äì20% cost savings** through renegotiation and diversification.
